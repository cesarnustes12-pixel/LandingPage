# Project Status: CMC Salud Landing Page

## Summary

This document tracks the development progress of the CMC Salud landing page.

## Work Completed

### General
- **Framework/Stack:** The project is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

### Videos Section
- The layout has been adjusted to feature two videos.
- CSS has been fixed to ensure proper video display (`object-fit: cover`).
- A placeholder YouTube video has been removed.

### Products Catalog
- Test/placeholder products (Omega 3, Vit C Classic) have been removed from the catalog.
- An attempt was made to improve product images by switching to versions with white backgrounds (`_white.png` suffix).
- A global CSS rule was added to display a white background behind all product images for a more consistent look.

## Pending Work

### Image Quality
- **Critical Issue:** The files named `_white.png` (Melena de León, Bisglicinato, etc.) are "corrupt" in the sense that they were saved with the checkerboard pattern flattened into the image.
- **Required Action:** Regenerate these assets to ensure a pure white background.

- [ ] Melena de León (`melena_de_leon_white.png`)
- [ ] Gummimas Bisglicinato (`gliscinato_magnesio_white.png`)
